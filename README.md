Design Choices for My Image Gallery

I opted for a grid layout to organize my images. It creates a neat and visually pleasing arrangement.

The `display: grid` property ensures equal columns, maintaining a consistent structure.

I set the images to occupy the entire width of their container (`style={{ width: '100%', height: '80%' }}`). This ensures they scale proportionally.
